# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of the analysis 

The purpose of this project is to analyze the employee database of the company Pewlett Hackard in order to find which employees are close to retirement, their title and how many of them are eligible for a mentorship program.

Regarding how many employees are eligible for the Mentorship Program, the research found that there are only 1549 eligible, representing only the 1.71% of the personnel reaching retirement. 

## Summary

In the nearby future, Pewlett Hackard will face the challenge of replacing 30% of its crew, most of them being seniors. The company should start the mentorship program as soon as possible to counterbalance the substantial amount of personnel that will retire in a short time. They could also implement tuition reimbursement benefits for MBA or Managements Degrees, to retain the best employees and prepare them to fulfill the Senior and managerial positions.
